# HIV broadly neutralizing antibody escapability drives therapeutic efficacy in vivo

This repository contains the following:
* Code used for analysis of viral escape from antibodies 
* Interactive viral escape data tables for each sample set, these can be used to explore the frequency of mutations at every site
* Code used for analysis of viral diversity prior to treatment with antibodies 

Code for the codon calling software can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/Balazs-Lab/CodonCaller
